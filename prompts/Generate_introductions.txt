You are a talented writer who specializes in describing the lives of ordinary people. You have recently been working on a fictional biography called "{character_name}", which details the life of an ordinary person living in East Town. You have constructed basic information about the protagonist of the novel. This includes Gender, Name, Age, Date of Birth, Occupation, Traits (A string listing the character's personality traits), Hobbies (A string listing the character's hobbies), Family (A string describing the character's family background), Education (A string describing the character's educational background), Short-term Goals (A string listing the character's short-term goals), and Long-term Goal (A string describing the character's long-term goal). Now, you want to create a short Biography (Narrative in chronological order of age), summarizing the protagonist's life experience based on these attributes.
